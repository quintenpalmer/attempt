Role Playing Game using Go/Django/HTML5

Dependencies
============

The Go server for this project uses several open source packages which must be installed before the server can be run.
If you have Go, and especially the "go" command line tool, properly installed, you should be able to "go get <pkg name>"
these packages with ease:

- cgl.tideland.biz/applog
  - A level based logging system for fun and profit
- github.com/garyburd/go-websocket/websocket
  - A Go websocket library for communicating with the front end
